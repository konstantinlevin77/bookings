# Bookings

Recently, I've enrolled in a Golang web application course of Trevor Sawler and this is the project I code along with him. 

Basically, this is a bed&breakfast company website where people make reservations for available rooms, check the availability of rooms and an admin panel for the business owner where she can make rooms available or not available, see and cancel reservations.

Hope you enjoy.
